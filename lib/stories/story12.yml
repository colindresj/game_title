  text: TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully {nervous} I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my {senses} --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the {earth}. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole {story}.

  title: Chapter Two
  text: It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my {brain}; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never {wronged} me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture --a pale {blue} eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.

  text: Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I {killed} him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a {dark} lantern, all closed, closed, that no {light} shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture {eye}. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every {night}, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.
